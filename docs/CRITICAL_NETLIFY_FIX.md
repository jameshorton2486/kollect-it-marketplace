# üö® CRITICAL: Why Netlify Shows Wrong Content

## Root Cause Identified

Your Netlify deployment is **NOT deploying from your GitHub repository AT ALL**.

### Evidence

1. **Repository has ZERO Shopify references** ‚úÖ
   - No "Drew's Projects" in code
   - No "Powered by Shopify" in code
   - No "lonefox" references anywhere

2. **Netlify shows Shopify/Lone Fox site** ‚ùå
   - Static furniture store
   - "Powered by Shopify" footer
   - Newsletter popups
   - Completely different content

### Conclusion

**Netlify is NOT connected to your GitHub repository!**

It's either:

- Deploying from a different repository
- Serving cached static content
- Not configured at all (showing default/test content)

---

## üîß Fixes Applied to Repository

### 1. Renamed `bun.lock` ‚Üí `bun.lockb` ‚úÖ

**Why:** Netlify requires `bun.lockb` (binary format) to detect Bun

```bash
# Before:
bun.lock      # ‚ùå Not detected by Netlify

# After:
bun.lockb     # ‚úÖ Netlify detects Bun automatically
```

### 2. Updated `netlify.toml` ‚úÖ

**Before:**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build"
  # Using npm, not utilizing Bun
```

**After:**

```toml
[build]
  command = "bun install && bunx prisma generate && bun run build"
  publish = ""  # Let Next.js plugin control this

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"

[[plugins]]
  package = "@netlify/plugin-nextjs"
```

### 3. Verified No Static HTML Files ‚úÖ

- No `index.html` in `/public`
- No static Shopify templates
- Clean Next.js app structure

### 4. Verified .gitignore ‚úÖ

- `.next/` ignored (build output)
- `.netlify/` ignored (deploy artifacts)
- `.env` files ignored (secrets protected)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What You MUST Do in Netlify Dashboard

These fixes are in the repository, but **you MUST manually configure Netlify**:

### Step 1: Verify Repository Connection

1. Log into https://app.netlify.com
2. Go to site: `same-a42equ68lfz-latest`
3. Click **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy**
4. Look at **Repository** section

**Current Status:** Probably shows "No repository connected" or wrong repo

**Required Action:**

1. Click **Link site to Git repository**
2. Choose **GitHub**
3. Select: `jameshorton2486/kollect-it-marketplace`
4. Branch: `master`

### Step 2: Verify Build Settings

After connecting repository, check:

**Build command:** Should auto-detect from `netlify.toml`
**Publish directory:** Should be empty (plugin handles it)
**Build image:** Should detect Bun from `bun.lockb`

### Step 3: Clear All Caches

**CRITICAL:** Old cached content may persist!

1. Go to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy** ‚Üí **Build settings**
2. Click **Clear cache**
3. Go to **Deploys** tab
4. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Clear cache and deploy site**

## üéØ Expected Build Output

When correctly configured, Netlify build logs should show:

```
‚úì Detected Bun (via bun.lockb)
‚úì Installing dependencies with bun...
‚úì Running: bun install
‚úì Running: bunx prisma generate
‚úì Generating Prisma Client...
‚úì Running: bun run build
‚úì Building Next.js application...
‚úì Creating optimized production build...
‚úì @netlify/plugin-nextjs deploying...
‚úì Site is live!
```

## üêõ If Still Shows Shopify Content

### Cause: Cached content

**Solution:**

1. Clear cache (as described above)
2. Delete `/.netlify` folder in repo if it exists
3. Force new build

### Cause: Wrong branch selected

**Solution:**

1. Check branch is `master` (not `main`)
2. Verify latest commit is shown in Netlify
