# üîß Deployment Fixes Applied

## What Was Wrong

Your Netlify deployment at https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app/ was showing a completely different website (a static Shopify furniture site) instead of your Next.js marketplace from GitHub.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **‚ùå Repository Not Connected:** Netlify was NOT deploying from your GitHub repository
2. **‚ùå Missing Environment Variables:** No `.env.example` file existed to guide configuration
3. **‚ùå Incorrect Build Configuration:** `netlify.toml` had wrong settings
4. **‚ùå SQLite Won't Work:** Your app uses SQLite which doesn't work on Netlify's serverless environment

## Files Created/Modified

### ‚úÖ New Files Created

1. **`.env.example`**
   - Complete list of all required environment variables
   - Comments explaining where to get each value
   - Serves as a template for Netlify configuration

2. **`NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**
   - Step-by-step deployment instructions
   - Troubleshooting guide
   - Environment variable setup
   - Database migration guide

3. **`DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md`** (this file)
   - Summary of issues and fixes
   - Quick action items

### ‚úÖ Files Modified

1. **`netlify.toml`**

   **Before:**
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "bun run build"
     publish = ".next"

   [build.environment]
     NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP = "true"  # ‚ùå Wrong!
   ```

   **After:**
   ```toml
   [build]
     command = "npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build"

   [build.environment]
     NODE_VERSION = "20"
   ```

   **Changes Made:**
   - ‚úÖ Changed from `bun` to `npm` (Netlify doesn't have bun by default)
   - ‚úÖ Added `npx prisma generate` to generate Prisma client
   - ‚úÖ Removed incorrect `NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP`
   - ‚úÖ Set Node version to 20
   - ‚úÖ Removed incorrect `publish` directory (plugin handles this)

## ‚ö° Quick Action Items

### CRITICAL - Do These First:

1. **Connect GitHub Repository**
   - Log into Netlify
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
   - Link to repository: `jameshorton2486/kollect-it-marketplace`

2. **Set Environment Variables** (13 required)
   - Go to Site Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
   - Add all variables from `.env.example`
   - See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` for complete list

3. **Switch from SQLite to PostgreSQL**
   - **CRITICAL:** SQLite WILL NOT work on Netlify
   - Get free PostgreSQL from:
     - Supabase: https://supabase.com
     - Neon: https://neon.tech
     - Railway: https://railway.app
   - Update `DATABASE_URL` environment variable

4. **Generate NEXTAUTH_SECRET**
   ```bash
   openssl rand -base64 32
   ```
   - Add this to Netlify environment variables

5. **Set NEXTAUTH_URL**
   - Must be: `https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app`
   - Or your custom domain if you have one

6. **Trigger New Deploy**
   - Clear cache and deploy
   - Watch build logs for errors

## üîë Required Environment Variables

Copy these to Netlify (fill in actual values):

```bash
# Database - MUST be PostgreSQL!
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require

# NextAuth
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=kollect-it-uploads
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

# Email
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
EMAIL_FROM=Kollect-It <noreply@kollect-it.com>
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@kollect-it.com

# Environment
NODE_ENV=production
```

## üìã Verification Checklist

After fixing:

- [ ] Netlify shows GitHub repository connected
- [ ] All 13 environment variables are set
- [ ] PostgreSQL database is set up and `DATABASE_URL` is set
- [ ] Build completes successfully
- [ ] Site loads without errors
- [ ] Homepage shows products from database
- [ ] Admin login works at `/admin/login`
- [ ] Can add products to cart
- [ ] No errors in browser console

## üö® Why Your Current Deploy Shows Wrong Content

Your Netlify site is currently showing a static Shopify site because:

1. **Not connected to GitHub** - Netlify is serving an old static build or test content
2. **No database connection** - Can't fetch dynamic products
3. **Missing environment variables** - App can't function properly

Once you follow the deployment guide, your Next.js marketplace will deploy correctly.
