# üéØ Netlify Deployment Fixes - Complete Summary

## üîç Problem Diagnosis

Your Netlify site (https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app/) was showing a **completely different website** - a static Shopify furniture store instead of your Next.js marketplace from GitHub.

### Screenshot Comparison

**What Netlify is Currently Showing:**

- Static HTML/Shopify site
- Vintage furniture products
- Newsletter popup
- "Powered by Shopify" footer

**What It Should Show:**

- Next.js dynamic marketplace
- Products from Prisma database
- Admin dashboard at `/admin/login`
- User authentication
- Shopping cart functionality

---

## ‚úÖ All Fixes Applied

I've made 4 critical fixes to your repository:

### 1. Created `.env.example`

**What it does:** Documents all 13 required environment variables

**Why it's needed:** Netlify needs to know what environment variables to set for your app to work

**File contents:**

```bash
# Database
DATABASE_URL="file:./dev.db"

# NextAuth.js
NEXTAUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-change-this-in-production"
NEXTAUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Stripe
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY="pk_test_your-key-here"
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY="sk_test_your-key-here"

# Cloudinary
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME="your-cloud-name"
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET="kollect-it-uploads"
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY="your-api-key"
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET="your-api-secret"

# Resend Email
RESEND_API_KEY="re_your-key-here"
EMAIL_FROM="Kollect-It <noreply@kollect-it.com>"
ADMIN_EMAIL="admin@kollect-it.com"

# Node Environment
NODE_ENV="development"
```

### 2. Fixed `netlify.toml`

**Before (WRONG):**

```toml
[build]
  command = "bun run build"           # ‚ùå Netlify doesn't have bun
  publish = ".next"                    # ‚ùå Wrong for Next.js plugin

[build.environment]
  NETLIFY_NEXT_PLUGIN_SKIP = "true"   # ‚ùå Conflicts with plugin
```

**After (CORRECT):**

```toml
[build]
  command = "npm install && npx prisma generate && npm run build"
  # ‚úÖ Uses npm (available on Netlify)
  # ‚úÖ Generates Prisma client
  # ‚úÖ No publish directory (plugin handles it)

[build.environment]
  NODE_VERSION = "20"
  # ‚úÖ Sets Node to version 20
```

### 3. Created `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`

**What it contains:**

- Step-by-step deployment instructions
- How to connect GitHub repository
- Complete environment variable setup
- Database migration from SQLite to PostgreSQL
- Troubleshooting guide
- Verification checklist

### 4. Created `DEPLOYMENT_FIXES.md`

**What it contains:**

- Summary of all issues found
- Quick action items
- What was changed and why
- Verification checklist

## üö® Critical Actions Required

You need to do these steps manually in Netlify (I can't access your Netlify account):

### Step 1: Push Changes to GitHub

```bash
cd /path/to/kollect-it-marketplace
git push origin master
```

### Step 2: Connect GitHub to Netlify

1. Log into https://app.netlify.com
2. Find your site: `same-a42equ68lfz-latest`
3. Go to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Build & deploy**
4. Click **Link site to Git repository**
5. Choose **GitHub**
6. Select `jameshorton2486/kollect-it-marketplace`
7. Select branch: `master` (or `main`)

### Step 3: Set Environment Variables

Go to **Site Settings** ‚Üí **Environment Variables** ‚Üí **Add a variable**

Add these 13 variables:

#### Database (CRITICAL - Must use PostgreSQL!)

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database?sslmode=require
```

**üö® SQLite WILL NOT WORK on Netlify!**

Get free PostgreSQL from:

- [Supabase](https://supabase.com) ‚≠ê Recommended
- [Neon](https://neon.tech)
- [Railway](https://railway.app)

#### Authentication

```bash
# Generate with: openssl rand -base64 32
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=abc123...your-32-character-random-string...xyz789

# Must match your Netlify domain EXACTLY
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app
```

#### Stripe

Get from: https://dashboard.stripe.com/test/apikeys

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
```

#### Cloudinary

Get from: https://cloudinary.com/console

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your-cloud-name
NEXT_PUBLIC_CLOUDINARY_UPLOAD_PRESET=kollect-it-uploads
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abc...xyz
```

#### Email

Get from: https://resend.com/api-keys

```bash
RESEND_API_KEY=re_...
EMAIL_FROM=Kollect-It <noreply@kollect-it.com>
ADMIN_EMAIL=admin@kollect-it.com
```

#### Environment

```bash
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Step 4: Deploy

1. Go to **Deploys** tab
2. Click **Trigger deploy** ‚Üí **Clear cache and deploy site**
3. Watch the deploy logs
4. If it fails, check the error messages

## üìä Verification Checklist

After deployment, verify:

- [ ] Site URL loads (not 404)
- [ ] Shows Next.js marketplace (not Shopify site)
- [ ] Homepage displays products
- [ ] Can navigate to `/admin/login`
- [ ] Can view `/product/[slug]` pages
- [ ] No errors in browser console (F12)
- [ ] Can add items to cart
- [ ] Admin login works (admin@kollect-it.com / admin123)

## üîß Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Module not found" error

**Cause:** Missing dependency

**Solution:**

```bash
cd kollect-it-marketplace
npm install
git add package-lock.json
git commit -m "Update dependencies"
git push
```

### Issue: "Prisma client not generated"

**Cause:** Build command doesn't include `npx prisma generate`

**Solution:** Already fixed in `netlify.toml` - just redeploy

### Issue: "Database connection failed"

**Cause:** Using SQLite or wrong `DATABASE_URL`

**Solution:**

1. Set up PostgreSQL (see links above)
2. Update `DATABASE_URL` in Netlify environment variables
3. Run migrations: `npx prisma migrate deploy`

### Issue: "Invalid session"

**Cause:** `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` or `NEXTAUTH_URL` not set

**Solution:**

1. Generate secret: `openssl rand -base64 32`
2. Set `NEXTAUTH_URL=https://same-a42equ68lfz-latest.netlify.app`
3. Redeploy

### Issue: Still shows old Shopify site

**Cause:** Repository not connected or deploying from wrong branch

**Solution:**

1. Verify GitHub is connected in Netlify
2. Check correct branch is selected
3. Clear cache and redeploy

## üéì What You Learned

1. **Netlify needs repository connection** - It doesn't automatically sync with GitHub
2. **Environment variables are critical** - App can't function without them
3. **SQLite doesn't work serverless** - Need PostgreSQL for Netlify
4. **Bun isn't available on Netlify** - Use npm instead
5. **Prisma client must be generated** - Add to build command

---
