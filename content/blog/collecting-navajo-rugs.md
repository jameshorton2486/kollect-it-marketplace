# Collecting Navajo Rugs: How to Assess Authenticity, Age, and Value

## Overview

Authenticity, condition, and pattern rarity drive value. Hand-spun wool, vegetal dyes, and selvage details are positive indicators.

### Quick Checks

- Look for lazy lines, side selvages, and hand-tied fringes.
- UV light can help spot modern repairs or dye issues.

> Tip: Document provenance and prior appraisals. Even short notes help future buyers.
