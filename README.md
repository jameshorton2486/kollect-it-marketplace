   ```
   DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-url
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-random-secret
   NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.com
   ```
5. Deploy!

```

Follow Netlify's Next.js deployment guide.

### **Database for Production:**

For production, migrate from SQLite to PostgreSQL:

1. Get a PostgreSQL database (Railway.app, Supabase, Neon, etc.)
2. Update `.env`:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:5432/database"
   ```
3. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   bunx prisma migrate dev
   bun run db:seed
   ```

## 🔐 Security

### **Before Production:**

1. **Change admin password**:
   - Edit `prisma/seed.ts`
   - Change the password in the admin user creation
   - Re-run: `bun run db:seed`

2. **Set strong NEXTAUTH_SECRET**:
   - Generate: `openssl rand -base64 32`
   - Add to `.env`

3. **Enable HTTPS** (Vercel/Netlify handle this automatically)
